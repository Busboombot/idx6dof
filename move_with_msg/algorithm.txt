For each step of the planner, the axis travels from x0 to x1 either in a target time, or at a target final velocity. 

# Move with specified time

Convert to specified velocity


# Move with specified velocity v1

Compute acceleration a

if a > a_max:
    Compute new v1 for a = a_max
    
    if v1 > v_max:
        v1 = v_max
    
    t = 2*(x1-x0)/(v1-v0)
    
else if a < a_max:
    Split in two
    first segment: x1' = x0 + a_max*v1, v1' = v1
    second seg: x1, v1
    
    
When processing multiple axes, first find the axis with the longest run time, according to distance / v_max for that axis. Then compute time for that axis and use that time to calculate velocities for all other axes 

The specified velocity is along the cartesian distance of
