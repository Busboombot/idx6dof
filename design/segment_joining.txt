Processing a path. 

Segments of a path must be processed together, with the first segment and the last segment having starting and ending velocities of zero. If a new segment is added to the path, the terminating segment can be removed, so the velocity does not got to zero in the middle of the path.

Points on the path can either be "waypoints" which the path must go through, or "control" points, with the path aims for. The difference is that all axis come to zero velocity on a waypoint, but can have a non-zero velocity at a control point. 

Each segment has a vector velocity, which is decomposed into joint velocities. 

Segments have three stages:
* Attack. Accelerating to max speed
* Sustain. Holding a max speed
* Release. Decelerating to final speed. 

Each segment must maintain a constant x, x=vt, so v and t can vary to maintain constant x. The segment is given a target velocity, vg, which may be adjusted  to maintain constant x

For 
	Fixed by end points
		v0 = initial velocity
		v1 = final velocity
	Fixed by max accel and decel
		tb1 = Acceleration break point
		tb2 = Deceleration break point
	Variable Params
		vs = sustain velocity
		t = segment time

x = vs*t - .5*tb1*(vs-v0) - .5*(t-tb2)*(vs-v1)

The v1 and v0 parameters are set to match the velocities of adjacent sections, then the other parameters are adjusted to maintain constant x with a goal of minimizing v-vg.

## Accel break and Decel break

vs = a*tb1 + v0
(vs-v0)/a = tb1

tb2p = t-tb2
(vs-v1)/a = tb2p ( a is usually negative)
-(vs-v1)/a - t = tb2


Then, solve for Vs.

## Minimum and maximum segment distances

Minimum distance for a segment is the area of the attack subsegment, so for a non-zero v0, there is a non-zero minimum distance. If the segment distance is zero, v0 must be zero. 

There is also a maximum distance, set by the max velocity, or by the max velocity achievable with the attack and release subsegments. The max distance can be increased by increasing the segment time.


## Aligning attack and release breaks

Find the join with the latest attack break, and move all of the other breaks back. The, all of the acceleration periods will align, maintaining straight line motion.
